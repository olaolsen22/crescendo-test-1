# Crescendo Collective: Test #1

We provide a mock api listing recipe information along with ingredients that are on sale. Using this information you create an app to browse and view recipes using a modern JavaScript approach. No designs are provided so you are free to create your own layout or leverage a framework for the design aspects.
